# Devops - Automated Builds Pushing to Dockeruhub Intro
For this assignment I want you to watch the following two videos and create your own GitHub Repo from scratch based on this repository. You will learn to setup a GitHub Action to implement a CI/CD workflow to automaticly test, build and push your program's image to Dockerhub. Add screen shots to this readme file where indicated that show the image published in your Docker hub account.

# Instructor Videos:
Important Docker Commands to Know
Automated Builds Complete Demo Note: I changed the code a little in my workflow to use an improved approach versus whats in the video I separated the jobs and used "needs" to require the test job to complete first
